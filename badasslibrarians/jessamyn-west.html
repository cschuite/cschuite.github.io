		<div class="librarian-text">
		<p class="first">Jessamyn West is a self-described "librarian, writer, technologist, justice of the peace, [and] moss enthusiast." Her first exposure to librarianship was in 1995, when she went to Romania and ran a library for the Freedom Forum. When she returned to the U.S., she got a graduate degree in librarianship at the University of Washington.</p><br>
		<p>West has worked as a library consultant and researcher for sites like MetaFilter, Wikipedia, and Google Answers. She is most famous for running Librarian.net, a website that is "pro-information" in many forms. She was an outspoken opponent of the USA PATRIOT Act and created signs for libraries to hang as a way of fighting government surveillance. West turned a library into a place of activism and saw information as a weapon to fight oppression.</p><br>
