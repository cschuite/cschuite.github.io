		<p>This website is a project for SI 539 (Design of Complex Websites), a class in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. The project prompt was to create a portfolio, but I'm a librarian, not a designer. My portfolio is limited. I chose instead to create a website celebrating my chosen profession in all of its glory and badassery.</p><br>
		<p>Designing a website was hard, but answering this question was harder: how to choose just a few badass librarians from the thousands that have existed over the centuries?</p><br>
		<p>I started by limiting it to just librarians from modern times. Sorry, Casanova and Ben Franklin! I also wanted to focus on people who are known primarily as librarians, so children's authors Madeleine L'Engle and Beverly Cleary, politicians Golda Meir and J. Edgar Hoover, and First Lady Laura Bush all had to go. There was a great temptation to include fictional librarians&mdash;I think Rupert Giles and Tammy II are two of the best characters ever created&mdash;but there were already too many real-life kickass librarians to choose from, so I reluctantly removed the fictional ones from the running. In the end, I decided to narrow the search to three women who have redefined libraries as places of activism and innovation. I look up to all of these women, and I think other aspiring librarians should as well. Check them out below.</p>
