		<p>How to choose just a few badass librarians from the thousands that have existed over the centuries?</p>
		<p>I started by limiting it to just librarians from modern times. Sorry, Casanova and Ben Franklin! I also wanted to focus on people who are known primarily as librarians, so children's authors Madeleine L'Engle and Beverly Cleary, politicians Golda Meir and J. Edgar Hoover, and First Lady Laura Bush all had to go. In the end, I decided to narrow the search to three women who have redefined libraries as places of activism and innovation. Check them out below.</p>
