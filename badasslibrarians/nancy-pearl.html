		<h1>Nancy Pearl</h1>
		<p>Nancy Pearl is a Detroit, Michigan native and earned her master's in library science at the University of Michigan. She worked as a librarian in Detroit and Oklahoma before being recruited to the Seattle Public Library as director in 1993.</p>
		<p>There she became a "local celebrity" through initiatives like 'If All Seattle Read The Same Book,' which was later adopted by other major cities' public library systems. She also published books of book recommendations and collaborated with Amazon to bring out-of-print books back into circulation through the Book Lust Rediscoveries program. A Seattle company created a Nancy Pearl action figure in 2003, and it is still available for purchase today.</p>
