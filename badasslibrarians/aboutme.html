		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm Caroline. I'm an aspiring librarian, currently getting a graduate degree in Information Science from the University of Michigan. I have been fortunate to gain experience with several libraries during my time at Michigan, which has only deepened my lifelong conviction that these spaces are centers of learning, creation, and democracy. I also believe that librarians are total badasses. On this website, a project for my Design of Complex Websites class, I have compiled introductions to just a few of the rock star librarians at work today. Check them out below.</p>
